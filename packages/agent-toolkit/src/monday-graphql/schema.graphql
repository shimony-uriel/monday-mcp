  Retrieve audit logs for your Monday account. You can
      filter logs by event types, user ID, IP address and start and end date.
      
      Here is an example audit log query:

        audit_logs(
          user_id: "1234567890"
          events: ["login", "logout"]

          start_time: "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"
          end_time: "2021-01-01T23:59:59Z"
          limit: 100
          page: 1
        ) {
          logs {

Behaviour:
• When a layout is created the system automatically generates

• The layout block itself is just a container; each generated cell block has
  parentBlockId === <layout-block-id> and acts as the direct parent for any
  content you want to insert into that column.
• The creation response already contains the ordered list of generated cell
  IDs under `content[0].cells` (1-D array from left to right).
• To populate a layout:
    1. Create the layout and capture its ID.
    2. Obtain the cell block IDs either by inspecting `content[0].cells`
       in the response **or** by querying the document for children of the
       layout block.
    3. Create your content blocks (textBlock, imageBlock, tableBlock, etc.)
       with parentBlockId set to the specific cell block ID.
• Use afterBlockId only to order siblings *within* the same cell.

Input for creating table blocks.
⚠️  RECOMMENDATION: Use add_content_to_doc_from_markdown with markdown tables instead for simpler table creation.
Behavior:
- When a table is created, the system automatically generates `row_count × column_count` child "cell" blocks (one per cell).
- The table block is a container. Each generated cell block has `parentBlockId === <table-block-id>` and is used to insert content.

Important:
- Always use the 2D matrix returned under `content[0].cells` to access cells.
- This matrix is row-major: `matrix[rowIndex][columnIndex]`.
- Do not rely on the order returned by `docs { blocks { ... } }`, as it's implementation-specific.

Recommended workflow:
1. Create the table and capture its ID.
2. Read `content[0].cells` to get the cell ID matrix.
3. Use bulk create blocks to create all the child blocks (e.g. textBlock, imageBlock) with `parentBlockId = matrix[row][col]`.
   Use `afterBlockId` only to order siblings within the same cell.
